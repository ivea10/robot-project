# robot-project
This project implements an autonomous robot controlled by a STM32 Nucleo board. After pressing the Start button, the robot scans its environment using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to detect objects. Once an object is detected, the robot aligns itself, approaches it, and maintains a 20 cm distance.
